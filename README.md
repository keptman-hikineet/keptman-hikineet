# About me

Hi, I'm keptman-hikineet (altho my [Twitter handle](https://twitter.com/oikos_mcnomos) is something else). I'm an economics research assistant, with a primary interest in environmental economics. That's not my main job; my main job now is working with input-output and AHP (which is satisfying in its own way). Unfortunately, I'm the code monkey in my team, and so I will be doing a lot of coding for this job. Hopefully my work here can save the next RA from crying in blood or something.

I'm new to GitHub, so please guide me, *senpai*.
